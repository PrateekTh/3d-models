# 3D Modelling

This repository contains some of my 3D Models, made on blender. The focus is on creating efficient topology, and use techniques that will enable low-end systems (and web browsers) to render them easily.

- ### Tomodachi

  A low-poly 3D model (scene) of "Friend" from 20th Century Boys, a really great manga by Urasawa. The steps involved were:

  - Gathering references
  - Modelling, with good, and low topology
  - UV Unwrapping, and marking proper seams
  - Texture painting
  - Manual Rigging from scratch and weight painting

- ### Jojolion

  A low-poly model of character - Josuke Higashikata from JJBA part 8 - JOJOLION.

  - Gathering references
  - Modelling, with good, and low topology
  - Vertex-based coloring (using multiple materials)
  - Manual Rigging from scratch

- ### Lighthouse
  A lighthouse scene (under construction)
