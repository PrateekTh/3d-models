# 3D Modelling

This repository contains some of my 3D Models, made on **Blender**. The focus is on creating efficient topology, and use techniques that will enable low-end systems (and web browsers) to render them easily.

- ### Tomodachi

  A low-poly 3D model (scene) of "Friend" from 20th Century Boys, a really great manga by Urasawa. The steps involved were:

  - Gathering references
  - Modelling, with good, and low topology
  - UV Unwrapping, and marking proper seams
  - Texture painting (Folder contains the texture file)
  - Manual Rigging from scratch and weight painting

#### Renders : 
The base mesh uses a basic emission shader material, with the texture as the colormap.
The world background contains a procedural texture made using blender's shading nodes.

- ### Jojolion

  A low-poly model of character - Josuke Higashikata from JJBA part 8 - JOJOLION.

  - Gathering references
  - Modelling, with good, and low topology
  - Vertex-based coloring (using multiple materials)
  - Manual Rigging from scratch
 
  #### Renders :
  The base mesh contains the individual materials, associated to various faces.
  The background is a custom procedural texture made using shading nodes, along with a text with a volumetric shader, and a translucent BSDF surface.

- ### Lighthouse
  A lighthouse (under construction)

  I will eventually use these to create scenes/animations, and test out shaders I create in the shaders repository.
